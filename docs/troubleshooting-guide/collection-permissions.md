# Troubleshooting collection permissions

This guide deals with access to view or edit questions and dashboards. If someone has the wrong access to data such as the tables, rows, or columns that are displayed in a question or dashboard, see [Troubleshooting data permissions](#troubleshooting-data-permissions).

## People can't access a dashboard from a collection that they have permissions for

1. Go to the save location (the collection) for each _question_ on the dashboard.
2. If the saved questions are in a collection that people don't have access to, you can either:
    - Grant people permission to the collection with the saved questions.
    - Move the saved questions for the dashboard to a collection with permissions.

**Explanation**

Moving a dashboard to a collection with permissions does not automatically move all of the saved questions into the same collection. If the saved questions are stored in a restrictive collection (such as someone's personal folder), then other people will not be able to view those cards.
