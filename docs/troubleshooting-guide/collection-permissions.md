# Troubleshooting collection permissions

Use this guide if you're having trouble with permissions to _view or edit_ questions or dashboards.

If someone has the wrong level of access to the tables, rows, or columns that are displayed in a question or dashboard, see [Troubleshooting data permissions][troubleshooting-data-permissions].

## People can't access a dashboard from a collection that they have permissions for

1. Check where each _question_ on the dashboard is saved (i.e., which collection).
2. If the saved question is in a collection that people don't have access to, you can either:
    - Grant people permission to the collection.
    - Move the saved question to a collection with broader permissions.

**Explanation**

Moving a dashboard to a collection with permissions does not automatically move all of the saved questions into the same collection. If the saved questions are stored in a restrictive collection (such as someone's personal folder), then other people will not be able to view those cards.
